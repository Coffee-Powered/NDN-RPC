# Steps to run

- vagrant up 

- vagrant ssh

- git clone https://github.com/Coffee-Powered/NDN-RPC.git

- cd NDN-RPC/testbed

- make run TASK="sprintlink fwh" CLI=(variable) SRV=(variable) (optional)SIZE=(variable)

# How to configure the simulation

Change CLI, SRV and SIZE to whatever you want (max nodes: 315)

Deleting the SIZE variable will cause the script to default to using the full network size.

# Test simulation

## Running a test

A test can be performed in relatively little time, adding "time" to the start of the make command showed this test takes around 7 mins

- cd NDN-RPC/testbed

- make run TASK="sprintlink fwh" CLI=1 SRV=1 SIZE=10

Wait for the script to emulate the network and initiate the application on client and server.

The experiment is running when the output reads "Timer set for 300 seconds." (this gives the experiment time to perform before><item>Experiment should conclude with strings that read something like "All hosts have completed." and "Hosts encountered errors."

The errors being highlighted in this context is usually caused by tcpdump outputting strings to stderr.

- cd logs

The logs generated by the experiment should be stored here.

For this test simulation, there should be .out and .err files for s5 (node 5, the server) and c4 (node 4, the client).

Using vim or nano, you can open either of the .out files which contains all the recorded output of the experiment from the perspective of the individual hosts.

## Expected results.

The .out files are the main method of observing the experiment.

### Opening c4.out will show:

A print out of ifconfig for that host (was for checking the existence of duplicate links).

Statements from the prefix search loop as it waits for RPC names to reach its FIB table.

Statements where it is about create an Interest for a random RPC it detected.

Print outs of Data packets it received back.

Statements about advertising itself as an param server.

Print outs of Interests it received requesting params.

A statement that reads "End of Script."

### Opening s5.out will show:

A print out of ifconfig for that host (was for checking the existence of duplicate links).

Statements about the advertisement of its functions.

Print outs of Interests it received requesting RPC.

Statements about sending replies back to callers.

Statements where it is about create Interests to obtain params for RPC calls it receives.

Print outs of Data packets it received back.

A statement that reads "End of Script."
